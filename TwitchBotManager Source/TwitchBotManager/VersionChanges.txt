///////////// Version 0.2.1 : The Last Song Request overhaul ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

As a last resort to stop stuttering/buffering/songs not loading, I have completely overhauled how the song request system workes.
Instead of storing song data then streaming the video from the stored youtube link, the bot now downloads and caches all secondary songs
and the next few song requests the bot will play.
The bot will distinguish between songs already cached and songs it needs to download ready.
Because new requests into an empty list can take a few seconds, I added a message to output when a message command is received.
This can be disabled in the new setting tab.
Areas will be untested so be careful with areas of the song system, however they should work fine.

If the requests dont work smoothly now then I dont know what to do or whats up with it, this has been so frustating that I'm taking a break from this
for a few weeks, had to work so hard to move everything over to the new system that I need a break and do something else.
If you find a bug let me know and I will fix it as soon as I can.

After this will be more command and chat interaction stuff when I get back to work on this, also probably some customization stuff for the bot in settings
but we will see when I start again.

///////////// Version 0.2 : get_video_info Nightmare... ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

So "https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=" went offline for good suddenly it seems, the whole backbone of the song system...
Because of the major changes to the system I might as well make this v0.2 even though no new features were added.
The new system implements youtube-dl which requires FFMPEG, both files are included in the project for the time being.
Features listed as plans for v0.2 are now the plans for v0.3 once issues with the new system have been ironed out.
On a positive side, this new system allows for Audio only downloads, so that system is coming much sooner than previously thought.

Important notes however:
- 86x support has been removed due to FFMPEG version limitations.
- Currently for the song loader, some songs are going missing when being added to the lists, so writing the updated info to the song file has been removed
to prevent saved songs being lost. (Fixed)
- Size of the download song request has not been measured against the old system, please take care with downloads. (Fixed)
- Currently due to get_video_info going down youtube-dl has posted that age restricted content currently doesnt work. 
(There are work arounds but we might as well see if they can fix it soon anyway)
