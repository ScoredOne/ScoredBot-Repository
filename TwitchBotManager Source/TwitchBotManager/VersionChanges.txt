///////////// Version 0.2 : get_video_info Nightmare... ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

So "https://www.youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=" went offline for good suddenly it seems, the whole backbone of the song system...
Because of the major changes to the system I might as well make this v0.2 even though no new features were added.
The new system implements youtube-dl which requires FFMPEG, both files are included in the project for the time being.
Features listed as plans for v0.2 are now the plans for v0.3 once issues with the new system have been ironed out.
On a positive side, this new system allows for Audio only downloads, so that system is coming much sooner than previously thought.

Important notes however:
- 86x support has been removed due to FFMPEG version limitations.
- Currently for the song loader, some songs are going missing when being added to the lists, so writing the updated info to the song file has been removed
to prevent saved songs being lost.
- Size of the download song request has not been measured against the old system, please take care with downloads.
- Currently due to get_video_info going down youtube-dl has posted that age restricted content currently doesnt work. 
(There are work arounds but we might as well see if they can fix it soon anyway)
